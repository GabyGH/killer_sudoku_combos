I want to create a simple aid for Killer Sudoku puzzles that figures out what valid combinations are available for a set of 'Cages'. For now I'm working out the basic logic, but in the end this should have an interface where you input multiple cages in the form of the Sum value and the amount of squares and it throws out the combinations and any remaining possible values if the number of fields in the cages doesn't add up to 9. Later refinements could include multiple front-ends such as a web frontend and mobile frontends but for now I'll create a CLI frontend first. All the code is generated by ChatGPT CodePilot because I can read Rust but not write it and want to see if this can even be done. Once the project progresses and I get more confident, I might try some refinement myself but I doubt I will be able to beat CodePilot in the foreseeable future for such simple logic.
